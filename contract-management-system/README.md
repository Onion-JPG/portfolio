## Project Mission
### What we are building:
We are developing a comprehensive contract management system that offers users a seamless and structured experience in the contract signing process. This system is designed to ensure that users follow a well-defined sequence of steps without the option to skip any crucial stages. Our goal is to provide a guided and tailored contract editing and signing workflow.

### How we are building it:
**Web Application Creation:** We are in the process of developing a web application that will be hosted on Miami Hosted Servers. This choice of hosting enables us to engage a wide range of testers without the limitations associated with a locally hosted site.

**Implementation of a Web Framework:** To enhance user experience and accommodate various user preferences, we are implementing a robust web framework. This framework will enable server-side rendering of our application, allowing for dynamic content delivery tailored to individual user profiles when they access the site.

## Success Criteria
